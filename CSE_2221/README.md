CSE2221(Software_I)

Please be aware of the following key points:
1. Don't forget to include your name.
2. When submitting the project, make sure to package the entire project into a ZIP file and export your code as a PDF file.
3. Itâ€™s recommended that you write some test cases for your code to identify potential issues. This will be part of the grading criteria and is also a topic covered later in the course.
4. Stay mindful, composed, and optimistic.

All the best to you!!!
